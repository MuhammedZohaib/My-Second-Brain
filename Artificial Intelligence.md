## Machine Learning
Machine Learning is all about modelling.
Three Types of Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Re-enforcement Learning


### Supervised Learning
We have a target column
There are two types of supervised learning:
1. Classification: assign each data observation the class/category it may belong to
- Binary Classification
- Multiclass Classification
2. Regression: assigning any specific value

### Unsupervised Learning
We have no target column, looks at the whole dataset and tries to identify patterns
- Clustering: identifying groups in your dataset (K-means, DBSCAN)
- Anomaly Detection (identifying outliers)
- Association Rule Discovery (events that happens together)
- Time-series forecasting


### Re-enforcement Learning
Not common uses complex mathematics like game theory. e.g. chess bot finding its next move.


## Machine Learning Workflows

1. Data sets don't come with the predefined features so we need to identify features.
2. Split dataset into two datasets. *Train Dataset* and *Test Dataset*
3. Train Machine Learning model on Train Dataset
4. Evaluate Model on Test Dataset

## Evaluating Performance

- Accuracy = correct observations / all observations
- confusion matrix

Sensitivity = true positives / true positives + false negatives
Specificity = true negatives / true negatives + false positives


If we are not satisfied with the performance of our model then we go for
- Dimensionality reduction
- Hyperparameter reduction
- Ensemble methods


## Challenges in LLM

- Word Sequence
- Understanding Sequence
- Long-range Dependency

### Single Task Learning
- Task Specific
- Less Flexible
- Traditional Models and early LLMs

### Multi-task Learning
- Versatile
- Multiple tasks
- More developed LLMs

## LLM
- Text Pre-processing
- Text Representation
- Pre-training
- Fine-tuning
- Advanced Fine-tuning

## Overview of NLP
- Tokenization: Splits text into individual words or tokens
