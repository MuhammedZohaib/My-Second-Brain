# My Second Brain

Welcome to my personal notes repository, where I store all of my notes and thoughts as a "second brain." All of the notes are written in the markdown language for easy reading and organization.

   2. [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/)
   3. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with the [MarkdownEditing](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing) package installed
