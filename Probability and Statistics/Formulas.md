**Rate:**
 (x/y) or (y/x+y)

 **Ratio:**
 (x/x+y) or (y/x+y)
 
 **Percentage:**
 {(x/x+y)* 100} or {(y/x+y)* 100} or (**Ratio** * 100)
 
 **Burge's Formula:**
 This formula is used to make number of classes in Heterogenous type of data.
 1+3.3logN where N is the total number of observations.
 
 **Arithematic Mean for Population:**
 (μ) = ∑X / N
 
 **Arithematic Mean for Sample:**
 X = ∑X / n
 
 **For Even Number of Observations:**
X = {|n/2| th + {|n/2| + 1}th} / 2
 
 **For Odd Number of Observations:**
X = {|n/2| + 1} th observation

**Quartiles For Even Number of Observations:**
~X = |n.i / 4| + 1

**Quartiles For Odd Number of Observations:**
~X = { |n.i / 4| + |n.i / 4| + 1 } / 2

**Co-efficient of Range:**
Co-efficient of range = Xmax - Xmin / Xmax + Xmin
