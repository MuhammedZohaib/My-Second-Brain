# Statistics:
The branch of mathematical science that deals with the collection of data, organization of data, summerization of data, presentation of data and analysis of data under the face of uncertainityt to make inference about any phenomenon is know as Statistics.

**Science** -> To explore, To integrate, To design.

* **Deterministic** -> Outcome is Certain
* **Probabilistic** -> Outcome is Uncertain

*Inference Means Draw Concolusion.*

# Types of Statistics:
1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
The Branch of statistics that deals with collection, arrangments, summerization and the transaction of data.

2. **Inferential Statistics**
The Branch of statistics that deals with a sample data to draw a conclusion about the population.


## Population:
The collection of things having atleast one common chracteristics is known as Population.

## Sample: 
A Subset or part of a population is known as a sample.

## Representative Sample:
A sample that possess all the chracteristics of a population is known as a representative sample.

## Random Sample:
A sample in which each of a member of a population has a chance to be a part of sample is known as a random sample.

## Census:
The study of all elements/members of a population is known as census.

## Sample Survey:
The study of all elements/members of a sample is known as sample survey.

**GIGO** -> Garbage in Garbage out

# Hirarchy of Data:
--> Population: 
* Elements -> Any part or entity belongs to a sample or population.
* Variables -> Any characteristics that belongs to any element/member.
* Observation ->The value associated with an element of a variable.
* Data -> The set or collection of observations known as data.
* Information -> The processed data is known as Information.

We need Information to make decision and draw concolusions.

# Types of data:
* **Qunatitative Data**
* **Qualitative Data**

**Qunatitative Data:** A variable that can be described numerically.
1. Discrete Quantitaive Data  
* Countably Finite -> Students of BCS-B
* Countably Infinite ->Students in Whole world

2. Continuous Qualitative Data  
The variable which is comprised of possible points which exist between A and B on a line.

**Qualitative Data:** The type of variable which can be described on the basis of presence or absence of a certain quality is known as qualitative data.
* Nominal Qualitative Data
* Ordinal Qualitative Data
* Scale

## Raw Data:
A data which has not gone through any statistical treatment is known as raw data.

# Mutually Exclusive Event:
An event is said to be a mutually a mutually exclusive of occurrence of an event, denies the occurence of other possible event.

# Formulas:
[[Formulas]]

# Simple Frequency Distribution:
It shows the frequency of each data as its separate data value rather than groups.
# Group Frequency Distribution:
The distribution of data into group along with their value.

* Data -> Homogenous -> Simple Frequency Distribution
* Data -> Heterogenous -> Group Frequency Distribution
