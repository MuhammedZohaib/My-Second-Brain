**The shell decides if a path is absolute or relative by looking at its first character: If it begins with `/`, it is absolute. If it _does not_ begin with `/`, it is relative.**

* As shell doesn't have a trash can so once you delete file it cannot be recovered.
* Shell has a powerful function of auto-completion with `Tab`
* it's considered good style to put all flags _before_ any filenames, so in this course, we only accept answers that do that.

**`ls -R -F`** : `ls` has another flag `-F` that prints a `/` after the name of every directory and a `*` after the name of every run able program.
