1.  Start by creating a new React project using a tool like create-react-app.
2.  Create a new React component called "BubbleSort" that will handle the visualization of the bubble sort algorithm.
3.  In the BubbleSort component, create an array of random numbers that will be sorted by the algorithm. You can use the JavaScript Math.random() function to generate random numbers.
4.  Display the unsorted array in a visually appealing way, for example, using a list of divs or a table.
5.  Use CSS animations to show how the bubble sort algorithm works. For example, you can use CSS transitions to animate the movement of the numbers as they are sorted. You can also use CSS animations to highlight the elements being compared and swapped.
6.  To animate the movement of the numbers, you can use CSS transitions to apply a translation to each number as it is moved to its sorted position. You can use the "transition" property to control the duration and timing of the animation.
7.  To highlight the elements being compared and swapped, you can use CSS animations to apply a background color or border to the relevant numbers.
8.  Finally, you can use JavaScript to call the bubble sort function and update the state of the BubbleSort component as the sort progresses. This will trigger the CSS animations and show the user how the algorithm works.
