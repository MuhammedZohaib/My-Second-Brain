# Types Of Design Patterns:

Book by Four authors known as gang of four consist of 23 design patterns which are divided into following 3 categories:

-> `Creational Patterns` (Patterns Regarding Different ways to create objects)
-> `Structural Patterns` (Patterns regarding relationships between the objects)
-> `Behavioral Patterns` (Patterns regarding interaction or communication between different classes)

In java a container for one or more classes is known as a package but in other languages like C++ it's also known as namespace. for package name in java we use reverse domain name convention. 

With Interfaces we can build loosely coupled applications. An interface is a contract of capabilities of a class.

Follow Single Responsibility Principle, that every class should have a single responsibility
