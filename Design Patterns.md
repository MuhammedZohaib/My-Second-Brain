# Types Of Design Patterns:

The book by the "Gang of Four" authors consists of 23 design patterns categorized into three main categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Patterns related to different ways of creating objects.
2. **Structural Patterns**: Patterns related to relationships between objects.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Patterns related to interaction or communication between different classes.

In Java, a container for one or more classes is known as a package, while in other languages like C++, it's also known as a namespace. For package names in Java, the reverse domain name convention is used.

Interfaces allow us to build loosely coupled applications. An interface is a contract that defines the capabilities of a class.

It's important to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, which states that every class should have a single responsibility.

## Design Patterns:

- **Type Object Pattern**
- **Null Object Pattern**
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Architectural Patterns**
- **GoF Design Patterns**
- **The Singleton Pattern**
- **The Factory Pattern**
- **The Observer Pattern**
- **The Decorator Pattern**
- **The Command Pattern**
- **The Adapter Pattern**
- **The Template Method Pattern**
- **The Iterator Pattern**

## Memento Pattern:

The Memento Pattern deals with the problem of implementing an undo mechanism. It involves three main classes:

- **Originator**: The object that creates and stores its state in a Memento object.
- **Memento**: The object that stores the state of the Originator.
- **Caretaker**: The object that is responsible for the storage and retrieval of Memento objects.
