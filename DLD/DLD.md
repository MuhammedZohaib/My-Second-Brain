# Digital Logic Designs:
DLD stands for Digital Logic Designs.
* Logic Gates
* Minimization of Logical Expressions
* Number Systems

These Logic's can be applied on two different software.
*  Proteus
* Thinker-cad

## Diff. b/w Analog and Digital Values:
Analog Electronics can have a wide range of values they can range from negative , zero or to positive integers. There is no certain pattern or any limitation to analog values in Analog Electronics. Analog Values can make sinusoidal wave-forms. In analog electronics we deal with continuous waveform signals.
### Example:
Magnitude of the signal changes with respect to time.
Analog Electronic circuits are used for processing analog signals.
Since the signal is changing w.r.t time we cannot store it.
Analogue Circuits are tough to design.
In case of analog-signal a capacitor is unable to hold or to store a charge.

In Digital Electronics the waveform is not continuous in nature. There is no middle value there is a high and a low value. Either 0 as low or 1 as high.
Digital Electronics or Circuits are used to process digital signals. Digital signals can be used as a storage element because it is able to achieve a stable value for a certain period of time.
In case of digital signal capacitor is able to hold charge for a certain period of time. Less noise is produced during processing of digital signal and are easy to design.

# Logic Of 0 and 1:
The basic demonstration of logic 0 and 1 can be understood as:
* High voltage is considered as '1'
* Low voltage is considered as '0'

The graph is usually square waveform.


We can simplify Expression by using two methods:
1. Boolean Algebra
2. K-Map
