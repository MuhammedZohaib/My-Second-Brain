Most natural quantities that we see are analog. they can handle high power as compared to digital systems.
Digital values are discrete.
In digital elctronics there are two voltage levels.
One is high (1) and other is low (0).
one binary digit is known as bit.
The waveform of digital quantites is pulse form. Negative pulse form or Positive pulse form. 
From low voltage level to high voltage level.
Unit of frequency is Hz (Hertz).
f = 1 / T where T is time period.

Truth table provides a listing of every possible combination of values of binary inputs.

To find possible number of input combinations we use 2^n formula where n is number of inputs.
logic family of `and` `or` are TTL 

NAND/NOR gate is a self-sufficient (can build any logic circuit with it).
Can be used to implement AND/OR/NOT.

There are two types of logic:
 1. Computational Logic (Comparator,Adder,Subtractor)
 2. Sequential Logic


We can implement :
1. The encoding function (convert digital values/digits to binary values/digits)
2. The decoding function (convert binary digits to digital values)
3. The counting function 

**Multiplexer** (Multiple inputs one output) (Receiving End)
**DE-Multiplexer** (one input multiple output) (Transmission End)

flip-flop storage only stores one binary value
registers can store multiple binary values (Shift register)

DIP (Dual In-line Pins)

With DMM (Digital Multi-meter) we can measure Voltage Current Resistance

PLDs(Programmable Logic Devices)
