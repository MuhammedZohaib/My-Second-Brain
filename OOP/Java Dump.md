Access Modifiers:
 * public 
 * private
 * protected
 * default

Use of access modifiers:
One complete file of code is known as package.

A package with public access modifiers can be accessed in another separate package.

Data members with private access modifiers can't even be used in main() function. We use 
`Setter`
`Getter`

to access data members and methods of a private class/object.

```java
private String a = "Zohaib";

public void setName(string n){
name = n;
}
public void getName(String n){
return name;
}
```

```java
public void setId(i){
int i;
}
public void getId(i){
return id;
}
```

```java
/**
*This is a multiline comment
*Ok
*Mohammed Zohaib
*OOP
**/
```
